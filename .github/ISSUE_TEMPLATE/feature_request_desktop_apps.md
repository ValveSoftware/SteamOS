**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The SteamOS desktop mode, while functional, currently requires users to manually search for and install common desktop applications that many would expect for a fuller Linux desktop experience (e.g., a full office suite, advanced image editor, more system utilities beyond the basics). This can be a barrier for users less familiar with Linux package management or those who want a more "out-of-the-box" functional desktop for tasks beyond gaming.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
We propose that Valve consider one or both of the following to enhance the SteamOS desktop mode:

1.  **Pre-install a curated set of popular and useful open-source desktop applications.** These applications would provide a more complete desktop experience without users needing to immediately install them.
2.  **Create a "SteamOS Desktop Essentials" meta-package or a dedicated section in a software tool** that allows users to easily install a recommended set of desktop applications with a single click or minimal effort.

**Potential applications to include (examples):**

*   **Office Suite:**
    *   **LibreOffice:** A full-featured office suite (Writer, Calc, Impress).
*   **Advanced Image Editing:**
    *   **GIMP:** Powerful raster graphics editor.
    *   **Inkscape:** Vector graphics editor.
*   **Enhanced Media Playback:**
    *   **VLC:** Versatile media player (if a more basic one is default).
*   **System Utilities:**
    *   **GNOME Tweaks (or KDE equivalent):** For deeper desktop customization.
    *   **GParted:** For advanced disk partition management.
    *   **BleachBit:** For system cleaning and privacy.
*   **Development Tools (Optional, could be a separate bundle):**
    *   **Geany:** Lightweight IDE.
    *   **VSCodium:** Open-source binaries of VS Code.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
*   **Documentation Only:** While helpful (and being worked on separately), relying solely on documentation still places the burden of discovery and installation on the user.
*   **Third-party Repositories:** Requiring users to manage third-party repositories can introduce complexity and potential system instability if not done carefully.

**Additional context**
Providing a richer set of easily accessible desktop applications would:
*   Lower the barrier to entry for users wanting to use SteamOS for more than just gaming.
*   Make the desktop mode more immediately useful and comparable to other general-purpose Linux distributions.
*   Improve the overall user experience and versatility of SteamOS.

This would align with the goal of making SteamOS a capable Linux system for the living room and beyond. We believe that while gaming is the primary focus, enhancing the general desktop capabilities adds significant value.
