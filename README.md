Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter an issue while using SteamOS, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.  Some issues may have already been reported to other trackers, so it may be worth checking the following:

- [Steam for Linux](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues) for Steam Client issues
- [Dota 2](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues) for issues regarding Dota 2 on Mac and Linux/SteamOS.
- [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive/issues) for issues regarding Counter-Strike: Global Offensive on Linux/SteamOS.
- [Portal 2](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/portal2/issues) for issues regarding Portal 2 on Linux/SteamOS.
- [HalfLife](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues) for issues regarding Half-Life 1 engine (GoldSrc) games.
- [Source-1 Games](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues) for issues regarding Source games (HL2, TF2, CS:S, etc)

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block ([go here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com) if they are lengthy. Information on log locations and what to do with them can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/wiki/Reviewing-log-information).

When possible, please include a differential between a working configuration and the reported issue.

If a crash is involved, please include any CrashIDs or minidumps related to the issue in an archive. Archives can be drag and dropped into the text box of github.

For tracking purposes, there should be one issue per issue report.

### System information

System information can be gathered from within steam (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and include a link to it from your bug report.


Conduct
-------


There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Steam.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.
